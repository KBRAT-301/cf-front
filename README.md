- Idea for team KBRAT is to create an application so that a user can input data based on their habits and lifestyle, and this application will take that input and calculate the users carbon footprint.

- The pain point that this would be solving is helping/educating users realize the impact they have on the earth every day. Just the education alone will help spread the word and make for more thought-out decisions among the community.
- MVP will be to have a working app that can calculate at least an average yearly footprint for a user based on transportation data input.

- Stretch goals will include input for food consumption and home utility use.

## User Stories  

### User Story #1  

- As an environmentally conscious human, I want to see environmental data displayed aesthetically and enter my own data to see my personal contribution.  

### User Story #2

- As a user I would like to eliminate user error in the footprint calculator by only allowing user input as a drop down or slider.  

### User Story #3  

- “As a user, I want information, statistics, and images on the landing page to learn why my carbon footprint matters.”  

### User Story #4  

- As a user I would like the ability to see how large of a footprint I have, ways I can reduce my own footprint, and ways I can contribute as an individual by having the ability to find projects that I can donate to or support by sharing information.

### User Story #5

- As a user, I want to have the ability to log in and create a profile so I can access my specific data for future use.
