# Piano Keys ***(App title TBD)***  

## Meet team KBRAT

**Kyle Cohen**

- Idea for team KBRAT is to create an application so that a user can input a keyboard keystroke that cooresponds with a piano on the app. When key is pressed, a sound will be played.

- The pain point is giving users the opportunity to have an interactive experiance and provide musical feedback. Users will be able to save what they have created.

- MVP will be having a keyboard that is visual on the page and produces sounds when useing keystrokes

- Stretch goals add additional librarys and instruments.
