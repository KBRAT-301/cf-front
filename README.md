- Idea for team KBRAT is to create an application so that a user can input data based on their habits and lifestyle, and this application will take that input and calculate the users carbon footprint.

- The pain point that this would be solving is helping/educating users realize the impact they have on the earth every day. Just the education alone will help spread the word and make for more thought-out decisions among the community.
- MVP will be to have a working app that can calculate at least an average yearly footprint for a user based on transportation data input.

- Stretch goals will include input for food consumption and home utility use.
